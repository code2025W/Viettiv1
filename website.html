    <h2>Medical Career and Missionary Work</h2>
    <p>
      After becoming a licensed physician, Dr. Vietti joined the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA), a Protestant organization dedicated to spreading both spiritual and medical help around the world. She was assigned to a mission hospital in Ban Me Thuot, located in South Vietnam’s Central Highlands.

    <p>
      There, she focused much of her work on treating patients suffering from **leprosy** (Hansen’s disease), a condition that was heavily stigmatized and underserved. Dr. Vietti treated her patients with kindness, skill, and dignity — often under difficult conditions with limited resources.

    <h2>Decision to Stay — and Her Disappearance</h2>
    <p>
      As tensions escalated during the Vietnam War, many foreigners were urged to evacuate the region. Despite the growing danger, Dr. Vietti chose to stay, saying her patients needed her. This decision reflected her selfless character and unwavering dedication to her mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      On May 30, 1962, while preparing for surgery at the hospital, she was kidnapped by Viet Cong guerrillas along with two other missionaries — Archie E. Mitchell and Daniel A. Gerber. She was **never seen again**. No confirmed information about her fate has ever been discovered.
